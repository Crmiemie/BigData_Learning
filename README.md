# BigData_Learning
ðŸ‘‹This is my big data course learning note and project, which includes basic usages of scala, comprehensive experiments, and a big data-based meteorological analysis project (my final course project)

## Daily Experiments ðŸŒ„
Daily experiments include the following:
- Downloading and installing VMware
- Experiment template machine configuration (installation and configuration of Hadoop and Flink clusters)
- Interacting with HDFS
- Initial exploration of MapReduce
- Application of the distributed database Hbase
- Flink DataStream API programming practice
- Dataset API programming practice
- Table API & SQL programming practice

## Comprehensive Experiments ðŸŒƒ
Comprehensive experiments include:
- Big data analysis of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic in the United States
- Data analysis based on the YELP dataset
- Spark data processing and analysis based on credit card overdue data
- Movie data analysis based on the TMDB dataset
- Building real-time analysis dashboard using Spark+Kafka
- Data analysis and prediction of the Double Eleven event on Taobao
- Analysis and presentation of rental information in Xiamen
- Analysis and processing of CVPR papers' data from the last five years based on Flink
- Analysis of county information in the United States based on Flink
- Pokemon data analysis based on Flink

## End-of-term Project ðŸš©
The project involves meteorological big data analysis based on Spark.
The application of intelligent information in the field of weather information is the inevitable trend of today's social development. By using the data from the official website of the Central Meteorological Observatory,uses crawlers to extract the weather conditions of each city,processes and analyzes the data based on Spark technology,and uses the matplotlib to realize the visualization of the analysis result data. The realization of the system will have a positive impact on people's daily production and life.
